Project for ECE695: â€˜Victim Caches in GPUs: Using Idle Register Files to Preserve Victim Cache Lines

Description:
Due to the large number of concurrent threads executing on modern GPUs, there is high contention for the limited cache resources which consequently results in poor performance. Victim caching is a hardware technique which exploits data locality to decrease conflict misses and improve hit latency and is known to boost performance in CPUs. The use of these in GPUs has been limited. In this project, unused registers and registers allocated to throttled inactive CTAs are employed as victim cache space. When a warp is throttled, its data stored in registers is moved to an off-chip memory. The microarchitectural changes proposed in this project keep track of the locality exhibited by load instructions and assigns victim cache space exclusively to a few loads exhibiting high data locality. If any load finds data in the victim cache line, the data is directly copied to the destination register through a simple register-register move operation.
